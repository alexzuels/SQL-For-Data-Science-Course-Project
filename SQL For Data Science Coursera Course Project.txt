Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

## Used SELECT COUNT(*)
	From Attribute
I swapped the table names each time to get the new record count for all of the tables
	
i. Attribute table = 10,000
ii. Business table = 10,000
iii. Category table = 10,000
iv. Checkin table = 10,000
v. elite_years table = 10,000
vi. friend table = 10,000
vii. hours table = 10,000
viii. photo table = 10,000
ix. review table = 10,000
x. tip table = 10,000 
xi. user table = 10,000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

Select Count(Distinct(value*))
From Table

## I swapped out the table and value based for each one using the ER Schema to determine the primary and foreign keys

i. Business = primary key = id: 10,000
ii. Hours = foreign key = business_id: 1,562
iii. Category = foreign key = business_id: 2,643
iv. Attribute = foreign key = business_id: 1,115
v. Review = primary key = id: 10,000, foreign key 1 = business_id: 8,090, foreign key 2 = user_id: 9,581
vi. Checkin = foreign key = business_id: 493
vii. Photo = primary key = id: 10,000, foreign key = business_id: 6,493
viii. Tip = foreign key 1 = user_id: 537, foreign key 2 = business_id:3,979
ix. User = primary key = id: 10,000
x. Friend = foreign key = user_id: 11
xi. Elite_years = foreign key = user_id: 2,780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

I ordered by both fans asc and desc to see if ther was a stron correlation between the number of reviews and the amount of fans. 
There is some correlation as people with the most fans have well over 300 reivews, however the reviewer with the second most reivews
as determined in the previous question is not even in the top 25 of fans. Also there are people with 57 reviews with no fans. But the overall result is that fans and review count are positively correlated.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

I pulled together 3 queries limited to the top 10 results. I first sorted by fans, then useful, then funny to see how often a person top 10 in fans was also top 10 in useful and funny. 
5 of the top 10 in fans showed up in the top 10 useful and 4 of the top 10 in fans showed up in the top 10 funny. There does appear to be a medium correlation between the number of fans and how often they are useful and funny.
There are a couple outliers primarily being Harald who has by far and away the most useful and funny results with only being 3rd on the list of fans. W is the other outlier showing up in the top 10 for both useful and funny
while only having 4 fans. Plotting all the results would likely show a positive correlation between fans and the sum of useful and funny. 


	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
Select

b.name,

b.city,

b.postal_code,

b.review_count,

Case

When b.stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3'

When b.stars between 4 and 5 then '4-5'

End as starbreakdown

From business b

Where
 b.city = 'Phoenix'

I will be using Phoenix for my analysis as it had the second largest amount of reviews from an earlier query so we will have data density to analyze. 

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
Nothing that I could parse out. The hours seem to be pretty spread across the board with both groups of star breakdowns being open different days depending on the category. 


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Select

b.city,

Sum(b.review_count) as Reviews,

Case

When b.stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3'

when b.stars between 4 and 5 then '4-5'

end as starbreakdown

From business b 

where

b.city = 'Phoenix'

Group By starbreakdown  

Yes there is a variation in the number of reviews for each star breakout. 
+---------+---------+---------------+
| city    | Reviews | starbreakdown |
+---------+---------+---------------+
| Phoenix |    8125 |          None |
| Phoenix |    6530 |           2-3 |
| Phoenix |   19848 |           4-5 |
+---------+---------+---------------+
This data actually correlates with what we found earlier based on the number of times love and hate were used in a review. More of the reviews are much more positively rated rather than negatively rated.       
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
Select


b.city,

b.postal_code,

Sum(b.review_count) as Reviews,


Case


When b.stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3'


when b.stars between 4 and 5 then '4-5'


end as starbreakdown


From business b 


where


b.city = 'Phoenix'


Group By starbreakdown  


+---------+-------------+---------+---------------+
| city    | postal_code | Reviews | starbreakdown |
+---------+-------------+---------+---------------+
| Phoenix | 85013       |    8125 |          None |
| Phoenix | 85019       |    6530 |           2-3 |
| Phoenix | 85021       |   19848 |           4-5 |
+---------+-------------+---------+---------------+

The major thing is that the total for the zips match the total for the total breakdowns meaning either each postal code is heavily dominated by one majorly reviewed company as the data did not seem to be a nearly completel list of companies in the city. So the data set we have has a major business per zip and that is causing the star breakdowns per zip to look identical to simple star breakdown by city. 		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

Average star rating of the ones still open is slight higher both at an aggregate and when you pull it by city. All in average is 4.3% higher for businesses still open.    

+---------+---------------+---------+
| reviews |    avg(stars) | is_open |
+---------+---------------+---------+
|   35261 | 3.52039473684 |       0 |
|  269300 | 3.67900943396 |       1 |
+---------+---------------+---------+      
     
ii. Difference 2:
+---------+---------+----------+
| reviews | is_open | grouping |
+---------+---------+----------+
|   24531 |       0 | high     |
|   10730 |       0 | low      |
|  215484 |       1 | high     |
|   53816 |       1 | low      |
+---------+---------+----------+
 
However, despite the average only being 4.3% higher. Reviews that are 3 stars or below (Low group) make up 30.4% of reviews for closed business compared to 19.98% for open businesses a much larger delta. This likely could mean with further analysis that while the overall averages arent that different, closed business have a lot fewer strong ratings keeping fewer customers from trying them out the first time. 

SQL code used for analysis:
Select 

Sum(b.review_count) as reviews,

Avg(b.stars) as avgrating,

b.is_open,

b.city

--Count(r.text)

from business b 

--left join review r on r.id=b.id

--Where r.text like "%hate%"

group by b.is_open, b.city

order by reviews desc         
         
Select

sum(review_count) as reviews,

is_open,

Case 

When stars between 0 and 3 then 'low'

when stars > 3 then 'high'
end as grouping

from business

group by is_open, grouping       

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I would like to look at the correlation to how people rate a review and then the overall rating of businesses tied to that review. Is there a correlation to a review being funny or cool and the businesses star rating. 
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
 We will need to pull the actual business and their rating as well as the review count so we can ensure we are only looking at data that has enough volume. Then we will pull in the descriptors for the different reviews as well as whether
or not a business is still open to see if there is something there as well. Hard to anlayze with the 25 row limit in the data given.
